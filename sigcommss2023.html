                <b>Course description: </b>
                <br><br>Studies on spoken communication tend to confine themselves to analysis of the verbal message (what the speaker says). However, spoken utterances are often accompanied by a range of nonverbal features, such as pauses, hesitations, laughter, smiling, and other forms of body language - all of which have the potential impact the way we interpret the message.
                <br><br>In this seminar, we are interested in the role of such paralinguistic and extralinguistic signals in communication. When do speakers produce them, and how are they informative for listeners? How do they function in various communicative contexts, and what are some of their applications in real-world language use? As language scientists, what are some of the challenges and limitations associated with studying such signals? In addressing these questions, we will gain a broader understanding of how the linguistic, paralinguistic, and extralinguistic aspects of speech come together to shape communication.
