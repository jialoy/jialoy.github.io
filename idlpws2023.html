                <b>Course description: </b><p>It has long been observed in psycholinguistic research that group-level patterns can obscure variation that exists at the level of the individual. More recently, there has been growing interest in investigating the source(s) of this individual variability (e.g. cognitive, linguistic, environmental, or other factors), and how they come into play in the context of language processing. </p>
                <p>In this seminar, we will review papers that take an individual differences approach to the study of language processing, looking at the topic from both a thematic and a methodological perspective.  We will cover common measures of individual differences used in language research and examine how they can be relevant, how they are measured, as well as the reliability and limitations of various measures used.  In the process, we will explore how studying these differences can provide insight into broader questions relating to the mechanisms that underlie language processing.</p>
